# Donation Management Service
  
## Introduction

- This service handles user donation and user subscriptions. It exposes an API of:

  -  `donations` Which accepts users donations and thanks those who donate more than twoice.

  -  `users` Where users can register thier emails

- I intended to use SNS for the thanks thing, but I changed my mind later to SES to get an actual email sent by only verifing my own email `abdulrahman91kh@gmail.com`. So the API endpoint for `users` serves no purpose in terms of the challenge, but I decided to keep it as it is already implemented, may it helps to show how I thought about its implementation.

## Installation & Setup

- First of all, let's grap the challenge code. Use the following git command to clone the project
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Abdulrahman91kh/cruk.git
    ```
- We need to create an environment file `.env`, navigate to the project root folder, create a new file with name of `.env`, and copy the next snippet to your file, don't forget to change the variables values with yours
    ```
    ACCOUNT_ID=123456789
    REGION=EU-DIRECTION-X
    SES_SOURCE_EMAIL="abdulrahman91kh@gmail.com"
    ```
- You need to have your AWS ready and your credentials configured, you will need at least a defualt profile to deploy the project to. for more information please visit [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)

- Now you need to navigate to the project folder and install its dependencies, you can do it using: 
    ```
    cd cruk && npm i
    ```
- Everything is set and ready to get deployed, you can deploy using:
    ```
    npm run deploy
    ```

- **Important NOTE**: if you are doploying this to your sandbox, you will have to [create an identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html) first, otherwise, the sending emails function will throw an error and you will get an *internal server error*

## <details>
<summary>Extra commands</summary>
  - To run unit testing use `npm test`
  - To build the ts code into a bundle JS use `npm run build`
  - To destroy the stack after deployment use `npm run destroy`
</details>



## Live testing
### Postman Testing
- If you are willing to test this service using postman, you will find a postman collection and a postman environment variable files within this project files. Navigate to: `<rootDir>/<postman>/`
- Within the postman collection you will find examples for the expected responses in success and failure cases.
### Any other client
- If you are going to use any other client please find the following:
  - The service API URL is:
	    ```
	    https://dit4rtt93m.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod/
	    ``` 
  - the users Endpoint is: 
        ```json
        {
            "URL": "https://dit4rtt93m.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod/users",
            "Method": "POST",
            "Body": {
                "email": "example@email.com"
            }
        }
	    ```
    Where email is the subscriber email.        
  - The donations Endpoint details: 
        ```json
        {
            "URL": "https://dit4rtt93m.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod/donations",
            "Method": "POST",
            "Body": {
                "email": "example@email.com",
                "amount": 123
            }
        }
	    ```
    Where the `email` indicates to the donator email, and the amount is the donation in £ (numeric value only)

## Scalability & Resources
- This application is implemented using scalable technologies and resilience layered code, so when thinking about scalability and handling thousands of users, we would be limited with AWS resources limitations as following:
- Lambda limitation: Each of our API's endpoints is depending on just one lambda, when thinking scalability we should keep eyes on the number of concurrent lambdas happenning, the **default limitation of conccurent running lambdas is:** 1,000 / Region. For more info please see [this link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html)
- DynamoDB Limitations: DynamoDB by default is scalable, it's limitations will not affect this service with its current state (maximum item size and items per query). However, it is a good practice to set Read/Write capacity limits, to control the DynamoDB charges. for more info please see [this link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ServiceQuotas.html)
- SES Limitations: SES by default is pretty limited in terms of having thousands of users needed to recieve emails. It's just simple to get it live and running on my sandbox, but it is **by defualt limited to: 250 sending email request / 24 hours**, and also has a **sending rate limitation to: 1 email/ 1 second**. For more info please see [this link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/quotas.html).
- **Important Note**: All the previously mentioned limits (AKA quotas) can be increased by sending an increase request to AWS. For more info please see [this link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html)

## Scalability & Resources
- Keep structural logs.
- Keep logs insightfull without any sensitive information.
- In case of corss lambdas requests we may introduce a `correlationId` to be attached to logs.
- The `correlationId` would be a unique id that is generated from the first lambda serving a request and passed to the next lambdas.
- Using `correlationId` in cloudwatch insights page will help to see the request logs going from one resource to another and may be from one service to another.
- Easier request tracking = faster debuging.
- For such a simple service like this cloudwatch would be fine to query and filter requests and logs in different levels.
- If the service is scaled and got more resources into it, we can use `DLQ`s, to monitor `SQS`s and `Eventbridges`. We may need to use a monitoring tools such as `Newrelic`.

---

## Next improvements
- Exclude the tests from the build.
- Using the service name as a prefix to the service resources helps to identify the resource when the system gets more complex.
- Use a feature flag to turn on and of sending emails (in case of it is causing errors because of the identity thing).
- Split the stack creation test file into smaller ones to make it easier to read.
- Rename the users table to donators makes more sense in terms of scalling the service up.
- Add request and response validations
